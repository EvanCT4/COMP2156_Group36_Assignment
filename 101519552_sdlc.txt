What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software applications. It ensures high-quality software is developed in a systematic and cost-effective manner.

Phases of SDLC
Planning

Define project goals, scope, and feasibility.
Identify resources, risks, and timeline.
Requirements Analysis

Gather and document user/business requirements.
Define functional and non-functional requirements.
Design

Create system architecture and design specifications.
UI/UX design, database design, and system flow diagrams.
Development (Implementation)

Write code based on design specifications.
Use programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
Testing

Perform unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Identify and fix bugs before deployment.
Deployment

Release the software to users or production environment.
May involve cloud deployment, on-premises setup, or app store publishing.
Maintenance & Support

Fix bugs, provide updates, and improve performance.
Implement security patches and feature enhancements.
